Circuit switching on the Internet is described as “best-effort,” meaning that one of
the routers along the way can lose a packet before it reaches its destination. In this
case, the sender or receiver must somehow note that the packet was lost (perhaps by
receiving the next packet and noting that it is out of context) and re-requesting the
lost packet. This mechanism is fairly reliable in that two machines will usually (and
eventually) figure out what went wrong and resend the missing packets. Packet loss
causes audio and video to pause if the packets are eventually resent, and it causes
video to pause, drop out, and skip if the packets are not resent at all. In our analogy
of a public exchange point being a major airport, if it’s a “foggy day” at that exchange,
the part of the Internet that goes through that exchange can be slowed down (called
a brownout) by the data that can’t “take off.”
