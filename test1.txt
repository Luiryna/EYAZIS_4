Computers have been around for quite a few years. Some of your parents were probably
around in 1951 when the first computer was bought by a business firm. Computers
have changed so rapidly that many people cannot keep up with the changes.
One newspaper tried to describe what the auto industry would look like if it had
developed at a similar pace to changes in computer technology:
“Had the automobile developed at a pace equal to that of the computer during the
past twenty years, today a Rolls Royce would cost less than $3.00, get 3 million miles
to the gallon, deliver enough power to drive (the ship) the Queen Elizabeth II, and six
of them would fit on the head of a pin!” These changes have occurred so rapidly that
many people do not know how our modern computer got started. hello world
